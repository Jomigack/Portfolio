This is a basic MAUI Application Mini-game which is basically a GUI Version of Rock Paper Scissors, the stats are tracked below where the user chooses their option of weapon.
THis was coded because I was intreseted in learning a step up from C# Console Application Development, and so I began to work with MAUI, which is XML and C#, similar in the way that HTMl and JS work.
This is my first completed project in MAUI, so constructive Criticism is highly encourged!
Thank you for your time;
